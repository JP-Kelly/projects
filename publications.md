### Time, Technology and Narrative Form in Contemporary US Television Drama

**Author:** JP Kelly

**Publisher:** Palgrave Macmillan

**Year:** 2017

**Description:** This book examines how television has been transformed over the past twenty years by the introduction of new viewing technologies including DVDs, DVRs and streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime. It shows that these platforms have profoundly altered the ways we access and watch television, enabling viewers to pause, rewind, record and archive the once irreversible flow of broadcast TV. JP Kelly argues that changes in the technological landscape of television has encouraged the production of narrative forms that both explore and embody new industrial temporalities. Focusing on US television but also considering the role of TV within a global marketplace, the author identifies three distinct narrative temporalities: ‚Äúacceleration‚Äù (24; Prison Break), ‚Äúcomplexity‚Äù (Lost; FlashForward), and ‚Äúretrospection‚Äù (Mad Men).  Through industrial-textual analysis of television shows, this cross-disciplinary study locates these narrative temporalities in their socio-cultural contexts and examines connections between production, distribution, and narrative form in the contemporary television industry.

### 'Recommended for you': A distant reading of BBC iPlayer

**Author:** JP Kelly

**Journal:** *Critical Studies in Television*

**Year:** 2021

**Abstract:**
This sole-authored paper undertakes a 'distant reading' of the BBC iPlayer interface using the longitudinal dataset compiled for this project. It moves beyond close textual analysis of individual programmes to identify broader patterns in the platform's architecture and content prioritisation.

**Key Findings:**
- üìå **Decline of Channel Branding:** The study observed a significant decrease in the prominence of traditional BBC channel branding on the iPlayer landing page over the study period. This suggests a shift towards a more platform-centric approach to content curation, de-emphasizing linear broadcast affiliations.
- üìå **Editorial Curation:** Analysis of the data revealed a pattern of consistent content placement, suggesting that there is still a high degree of editorial control over the BBC iPlayer interface.
- üìå **Platform vs Channel Identity:** The findings contribute to understanding the evolving identity of public service media VoD platforms as they navigate the tension between their broadcast heritage and the demands of on-demand consumption.

### "What's on the interface tonight?" A longitudinal analysis of the publishing strategies of public service video-on-demand platforms in the UK and Denmark

**Authors:** JP Kelly & Jannick Kirk S√∏rensen

**Journal:**
This co-authored study compares the publishing strategies of public service VoD platforms in the UK (BBC iPlayer) and Denmark (DRTV). Utilizing longitudinal interface data, the research examines how these platforms present content to their audiences, considering factors like genre prominence, editorial selections, and platform-specific features.

**Key Findings (Specific to BBC iPlayer):**
- üìå **Strategic Genre Placement:** The analysis of the iPlayer interface revealed consistent placement patterns for specific genres (e.g., Film, Sport) in prominent rows. This indicates a level of editorial curation and predictable navigation, which can both guide users and potentially limit exposure to a wider range of content.
- üìå **Thematic Carousels and Editorial Focus:** The study identified the use of thematic carousels and editorial selections as key strategies for highlighting specific content and responding to cultural events or strategic priorities.
- üìå **Cross-National Comparison:** While focusing on iPlayer's strategies, the paper also highlights differences in approach compared to DRTV, providing a broader understanding of public service media's online content presentation.

### ‚ÄúThis title is no Longer Available‚Äù: Preserving Television in the Streaming Age

**Author:** JP Kelly

**Journal:** *Television and New Media*

**Year:** 2020

**DOI:** [https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1527476420928480](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1527476420928480)
*[Link to the publisher's website]*

**Abstract:**
This article examines several recent changes in the technological composition and market logics of television. It considers what these developments might mean for the medium‚Äôs preservational qualities and for our understanding of television history more broadly. By focusing on the growth of streaming, the increasing ‚Äúdatafication‚Äù of the TV industry, and the prominence of interfaces and catalogs, I demonstrate that the ephemerality of television is both intensifying and diversifying, creating a number of methodological challenges in the process. These developments are placed in a longer history of critical debates around the preservation of digital media and the prospect of a digital dark age so that we might learn lessons from the past that can be applied to the preservational challenges of the present. The article concludes by proposing a number of practical steps so that future television historians might be better equipped to avoid a ‚Äúscholarly dark age.‚Äù

### Television by the Numbers: The Challenges of Audience Measurement in the Age of Big Data

**Author:** JP Kelly

**Journal:** *Convergence: The International Journal of Research into New Media Technologies*

**Year:** 2017

**DOI:** [https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1354856517700854](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1354856517700854)
*[Link to the publisher's website]*

**Abstract:**
This article examines recent innovations in how television audiences are measured, paying particular attention to the industry's growing efforts to utilize the large bodies of data generated through social media platforms ‚Äì a paradigm of research known as Big Data. Although Big Data is considered by many in the television industry as a more veracious model of audience research, this essay uses Boyd and Crawford's (2011) `Six Provocations of Big Data' to problematize and interrogate this prevailing industrial consensus. In doing so, this article explores both the affordances and the limitations of this emerging research paradigm ‚Äì the latter having largely been ignored by those in the industry ‚Äì and considers the consequences of these developments for the production culture of television more broadly. Although the full impact of the television industry's adoption of Big Data remains unclear, this article traces some preliminary connections between the introduction of these new measurement practices and the production culture of contemporary television. First, I demonstrate how the design of Big Data privileges real-time analysis, which, in turn, encourages increased investment in ‚Äòlive‚Äô and/or ‚Äòevent‚Äô television. Second, I argue that despite its potential to produce real-time insights, the scale of Big Data actually limits its utility in the context of the creative industries. Third, building on this discussion of the debatable value and applicability of Big Data, I describe how the introduction of social media metrics is further contributing to a ‚Äòdata divide‚Äô in which access to these new information data sets is highly uneven, generally favouring institutions over individuals. Taken together, these three different but overlapping developments provide evidence that the introduction of Big Data is already having a notable effect on the television industry in a number of interesting and unexpected ways.

## Book Chapters

### "A Stretch of Time: Extended Distribution and Narrative Accumulation in Prison Break"

**Book:** *Time in Television Narrative: Exploring Temporality in 21st Century Programming*

**Publisher:** University Press of Mississippi

**Year:** 2012

**DOI:** [https://www.upress.state.ms.us/Books/T/Time-in-Television-Narrative2](https://www.upress.state.ms.us/Books/T/Time-in-Television-Narrative2)
*[Link to the publisher's website]*

**Abstract:**
In this chapter I argue that the new distributive regimes within the contemporary television industry have given rise to new narrative temporalities. In particular, a number of series such as 24 (Fox, 2001 ‚Äì 2010) bear many hallmarks of what has been called ‚Äúnetwork time‚Äù (Castells 1996), namely acceleration and real-time. Although scholars maintain that ‚Äúnetwork time‚Äù is the dominant temporality of the twenty-first century, I argue that the flexibility of distribution in contemporary television has resulted in multiple narrative temporalities. To illustrate this point I use Prison Break (Fox, 2005 - 2009) as a way to complicate and challenge many of the assumptions made by ‚Äúnetwork time‚Äù scholarship. By taking an industrial-textual approach this chapter highlights the interdependent relationship between narrative and distribution, whilst also revealing key differences between the seriality of shows such as Prison Break (which uses ‚Äúserialized seasons‚Äù) versus series such as 24 (which uses ‚Äúepisodic seasons‚Äù).

**DOI:** [https://shop.bfi.org.uk/ephemeral-media.html](https://shop.bfi.org.uk/ephemeral-media.html)
*[Link to the publisher's website]*

**Abstract:**
Online distribution became a significant part of mainstream television culture in the late 2000s. Wired magazine reported that the BBC iPlayer had increased in popularity by 150 per cent in 2008 alone and by mid-2009 was estimated to account for approx- imately 7‚Äì10 per cent of all UK online traffic (Chibber, 2009). Likewise, Hulu.com, a US-based aggregator of film and TV content, experienced a similar degree of success...
